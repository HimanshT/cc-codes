// Given a Linked List of size N, where every node represents a sub-linked-list and contains two pointers:
// (i) a next pointer to the next node,
// (ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.
// Each of the sub-linked-list is in sorted order.
// Flatten the Link List such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order.
