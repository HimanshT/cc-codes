// Given a string str, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that it can be found twice in the given string. The two identified subsequences A and B can use the same ith character from string str if and only if that ith character has different indices in A and B.

// A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous
