// Given an array arr[] of distinct integers of size N and a value sum, the task is to find the count of triplets (i, j, k), having (i<j<k) with the sum of (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]) smaller than the given value sum.


//the concept is that while moving pointer,if the value is greater end--,but if smaller,the total values having sum less will be (end-start)
