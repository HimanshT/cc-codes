// Given an array arr of n positive integers and a number k. One can apply a swap operation on the array any number of times, i.e choose any two index i and j (i < j) and swap arr[i] , arr[j] . Find the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to k together, i.e. make them a contiguous subarray.
